## In this project, we were assigned to create our own "Adventure" by using our prior knowledge of what we were taught on the last two subjects which was Git and GitHub. What we were recently taught was how to link files to other files in your code space account. In other words our Adventure that is on github is linked to our codespace where we can change file paths and change linked files.
